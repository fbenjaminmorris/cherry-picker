Cherry Picker is a service that allows you to find your dream classic motor and then run the vin through the National Highway Safety Administration and find out the status of the title, the specs of the car, and other pertinent information about the vehicle you have selected. 

In this project we used HTML5, Javascript, CSS, Yarn, React, Axios, Bcrypt, Express, Graphql, Mongoose, and nodemon.
